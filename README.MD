# Tecnolog e Informação


This project consists of a tutorial blog, where I post tutorials (mainly) on programming, but also about other tech stuff. 

It has been build using a static site generator call Jekyll. All themes, styling and  scripts were written from scretch using Liquid HTML CSS, vanilla JavaScript and YAML. Any functionality that requires a server side application is implemented using some API tha allows us to communicate to a third-party service.
